    - 📖 TLDR: VLM agents show human-like capability in mobile environments, but pose significant security risks, including system compromise and privacy leakage. Addressing the challenge of detecting these unsafe operations, this paper introduce a dynamic sandbox **MobileRisk-Live** and safety benchmark **MobileRisk**. Based on this, they propose **OS-Sentinel**, a novel hybrid framework combining a Formal Verifier for system-level violations and a VLM-based Contextual Judge.

    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [injection]
    - 📖 TLDR: VLMs used as mobile GUI agents are vulnerable to environmental injection, where adversarial UI elements like deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications contaminate the agent's visual perception. This bypasses textual safeguards and can cause privacy leakage or device compromise. This work introduces **GhostEI-Bench**, a benchmark using Android emulators to assess agent performance under these dynamic attacks.

    - 📖 TLDR: Most existing OS agents are designed for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such scenarios, this work proposes a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task completion. This work also introduce VeriOS-Agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying humans in untrustworthy scenarios. [Github](https://github.com/Wuzheng02/VeriOS)

    - 📖 TLDR: we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA deterministically ensures that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before executing the action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification. This enables runtime, rule-based verification of agent's actions, detecting erroneous actions even before they take effect. [Github](https://github.com/VeriSafeAgent/VeriSafeAgent)

    - 📖 TLDR: Multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) integrate vision, language, and action for unprecedented autonomy in GUI applications, but introduce critical trustworthiness challenges due to their ability to modify digital states. Existing benchmarks are insufficient. This work introduces MLA-Trust, the first unified framework evaluating MLA trustworthiness across four dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety, and privacy, using realistic web and mobile tasks.

    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [risk], [evaluation]
    - 📖 TLDR: With the rise of generative AI, autonomous agents for managing daily tasks via user interfaces are advancing. Prior work focuses on UI navigation mechanics, but the real-world impacts of agents' potentially risky actions are understudied. This research investigates the consequences of AI agents' mobile UI actions. They developed an impact taxonomy through expert workshops, synthesized realistic mobile UI data, and annotated it with our categories. Evaluating various LLMs, this work shows the proposed taxonomy improves their reasoning about action impacts. However, significant gaps remain in reliably classifying nuanced or complex impacts.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces the concept of Active Environment Injection Attack (AEIA), where attackers disguise malicious actions as environmental elements to disrupt AI agents' decision-making processes. The authors propose AEIA-MN, an attack scheme leveraging mobile notifications to evaluate the robustness of multimodal large language model-based mobile agents. Experimental results demonstrate that even advanced models are highly vulnerable to such attacks, with success rates reaching up to 93% in the AndroidWorld benchmark.
