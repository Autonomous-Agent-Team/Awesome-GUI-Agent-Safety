    - 📖 TLDR: This work evaluates Clawdbot using a trajectory-centric approach across six risk dimensions. The test suite adapts scenarios from prior agent-safety benchmarks and adds custom cases tailored to Clawdbot’s tools. Complete interaction trajectories—including messages, actions, and tool calls—are logged and assessed by an automated judge and human reviewers. Across 34 cases, results show uneven safety performance. Clawdbot performs well on reliability-focused tasks but struggles with underspecified instructions, open-ended goals, and seemingly harmless jailbreak prompts. Small misunderstandings in these situations can escalate into higher-risk tool actions. We analyze representative cases to identify common vulnerabilities and typical failure patterns in practice.

    - 📖 TLDR: HAICOSYSTEM is a framework that assesses AI agent safety in complex social interactions through a modular sandbox. It features a multi-dimensional evaluation covering operational, content, societal, and legal risks. Simulating over 8,000 interactions across 132 scenarios in seven domains, the study finds that state-of-the-art LLMs pose safety risks in 62% of cases, especially during tool use with malicious users. This underscores the critical need to address safety in dynamic human-AI-environment interactions. [Github](https://github.com/XuhuiZhou/HAICosystem)

    - 📖 TLDR: LLM agents use LLMs and tools to perform user tasks but face security risks from external environments, like prompt injection and malicious tools, enabling dangerous actions such as financial fraud or data leakage. The core vulnerability is **over-privileged tool access**. This work introduces **Progent**, the first privilege control framework for securing LLM agents. Progent enforces tool-level security by restricting agents to necessary tool calls while blocking malicious ones, using a domain-specific language for fine-grained policy control. Progent operates deterministically at runtime, offering provable security without altering agent internals.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper identifies three key risks, distinguishing them from traditional automation and general autonomous agents. Current evaluations prioritize performance, largely overlooking privacy and security. We review existing metrics and outline five challenges in using human evaluators. To address this, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework. This framework must incorporate risk assessments, enhance user awareness via in-context consent, and embed privacy and security considerations directly into agent design and evaluation.

    - 📖 TLDR: Research on LLM robustness to **jailbreak attacks** primarily focuses on chatbots, yet LLM agents, which use external tools for multi-stage tasks, pose greater misuse risks. This paper introduces **AgentHarm**, a benchmark of 110 malicious agent tasks (covering 11 harm categories) that tests whether agents retain capabilities post-jailbreak to complete harmful multi-step tasks. The evaluation found leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests even without jailbreaking. Simple universal jailbreak templates effectively jailbreak agents, enabling coherent, malicious, multi-step agent behavior.

    - 🔑 Key: [risk], [injection], [attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: LLM powered GUI agents perform tasks automatically by interpreting and interacting with GUIs. Their autonomy, especially when handling sensitive data, introduces new security risks. Adversaries can exploit the visual processing differences between agents and humans by injecting malicious GUI content, leading to altered agent behaviors or unauthorized private data disclosure. Our study characterized six attacks, testing them on state-of-the-art agents and human users. Findings show agents are highly vulnerable, especially to contextually embedded threats. Human oversight is insufficient, emphasizing the need for privacy-aware agent design and practical defense strategies.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper identified three key challenges in Federated Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): heterogeneous privacy, structural conversational differences, and dynamic network topologies. To solve these, they introduce Embedded Privacy-Enhancing Agents (EPEAgent). EPEAgent seamlessly integrates into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and context retrieval phases, minimizing data sharing to only task-relevant information. They also created a comprehensive evaluation dataset. Experiments confirm EPEAgent significantly enhances privacy protection while maintaining high system performance.

    - 📖 TLDR: To address the lack of high-quality, commercially usable safety datasets for LLMs, we created Aegis 2.0. This dataset features a novel, fine-grained taxonomy (12 main hazard categories, 9 subcategories) for classifying risks. It contains over 34,000 human-LLM interactions, annotated via a hybrid human+LLM jury pipeline. Crucially, lightweight models fine-tuned on Aegis 2.0 match the performance of models trained on much larger, non-commercial datasets. We also introduce a safety+topic training blend that improves model adaptability to new risks. All data and models will be open-sourced to advance LLM safety research.

    - 📖 TLDR: The adoption of LLMs requires robust security against attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking, which aim to bypass safety policies. To prevent LLMs from generating harmful content or taking undesirable actions, owners must implement safeguards during training and use additional blocking tools. Detecting jailbreaking prompts is crucial. This work proposes a novel and superior approach for jailbreak detection by combining text embeddings optimized for retrieval with traditional machine learning classification algorithms.

    - 📖 TLDR: This survey collects and analyzes the different threats faced by these agents. To address the challenges posed by previous taxonomies in handling cross-module and cross-stage threats, we propose a novel taxonomy framework based on the sources and impacts. Additionally, we identify six key features of LLM-based agents, based on which we summarize the current research progress and analyze their limitations. Subsequently, we select four representative agents as case studies to analyze the risks they may face in practical use. Finally, based on the aforementioned analyses, we propose future research directions from the perspectives of data, methodology, and policy, respectively.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces SafeBench, a new framework to better evaluate safety risks in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). It tackles limitations in current benchmarks by 1) automatically generating a high-quality, diverse dataset of 2,300 multimodal harmful queries across 23 risk scenarios, and 2) proposing a novel "jury deliberation" evaluation protocol where multiple LLMs collaboratively judge model outputs for more reliable assessments. Testing on 21 models (including GPT-4o and Gemini) revealed widespread safety issues, with insights into factors like image quality affecting performance. The framework is also extensible to modalities like audio. [Github](https://github.com/NY1024/SafeBench)

    - 📖 TLDR: As language models gain agency in personalized communication, assessing their privacy norm awareness is challenging due to contextual cases and a lack of realistic evaluation. This work introduces PrivacyLens, a framework that extends privacy-sensitive seeds into vignettes and agent trajectories for multi-level evaluation. Grounded in privacy literature, it reveals a gap: models like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even with privacy prompts. PrivacyLens also enables dynamic red-teaming by generating multiple trajectories per seed to probe leakage risks.
