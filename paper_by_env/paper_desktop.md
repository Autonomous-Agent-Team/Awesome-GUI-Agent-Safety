    - 📖 TLDR: Computer use agents, LLM-based systems interacting with GUIs via screenshots or accessibility trees, lack safety evaluation. This paper introduces OS-HARM, a benchmark built on OSWorld with 150 tasks across three harm categories: deliberate misuse, prompt injection, and model misbehavior (e.g., harassment, data exfiltration). An automated judge assesses both accuracy and safety. Frontier models (like o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated show high compliance with misuse queries, vulnerability to static prompt injections, and occasional unsafe actions.

    - 💻 Env: [Desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: Introduces macOSWorld, the first interactive benchmark for GUI agents on macOS, with 202 tasks across 30 apps (28 macOS-exclusive) in 5 languages plus a safety subset for deception attacks; evaluates 6 agents, showing proprietary CUAs outperform open-source and VLM-based agents, significant language gaps, and both grounding and safety challenges.

- [Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02391)

    - 📅 Date: Nov. 4, 2024
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [Web], [Desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [risk], [pop-ups], [attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper demonstrates that vision-language model (VLM) agents can be easily deceived by carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, leading them to perform unintended actions such as clicking on these pop-ups instead of completing their assigned tasks. Integrating these pop-ups into environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena resulted in an average attack success rate of 86% and a 47% decrease in task success rate. Basic defense strategies, such as instructing the agent to ignore pop-ups or adding advertisement notices, were found to be ineffective against these attacks.
