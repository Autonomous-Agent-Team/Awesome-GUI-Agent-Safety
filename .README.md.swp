    - 💻 Env: [Desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [evaluation], [risk/attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: Computer use agents, LLM-based systems interacting with GUIs via screenshots or accessibility trees, lack safety evaluation. This paper introduces OS-HARM, a benchmark built on OSWorld with 150 tasks across three harm categories: deliberate misuse, prompt injection, and model misbehavior (e.g., harassment, data exfiltration). An automated judge assesses both accuracy and safety. Frontier models (like o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated show high compliance with misuse queries, vulnerability to static prompt injections, and occasional unsafe actions.

    - 💻 Env: [Mobile], [web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [risk/attack], [dataset]
    - 📖 TLDR: Most existing OS agents are designed for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such scenarios, this work proposes a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task completion. This work also introduce VeriOS-Agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying humans in untrustworthy scenarios.

    - 🐙 Github: https://github.com/VeriSafeAgent/VeriSafeAgent
    - 💻 Env: [Mobile]
    - 🔑 Key: [method], [evaluation]
    - 📖 TLDR: we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA deterministically ensures that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before executing the action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification. This enables runtime, rule-based verification of agent's actions, detecting erroneous actions even before they take effect.

    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [risk/attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: LLM agents use LLMs and tools to perform user tasks but face security risks from external environments, like prompt injection and malicious tools, enabling dangerous actions such as financial fraud or data leakage. The core vulnerability is **over-privileged tool access**. This work introduces **Progent**, the first privilege control framework for securing LLM agents. Progent enforces tool-level security by restricting agents to necessary tool calls while blocking malicious ones, using a domain-specific language for fine-grained policy control. Progent operates deterministically at runtime, offering provable security without altering agent internals.

    - 💻 Env: [Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [evaluation], [risk/attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: Research on LLM robustness to **jailbreak attacks** primarily focuses on chatbots, yet LLM agents, which use external tools for multi-stage tasks, pose greater misuse risks. This paper introduces **AgentHarm**, a benchmark of 110 malicious agent tasks (covering 11 harm categories) that tests whether agents retain capabilities post-jailbreak to complete harmful multi-step tasks. The evaluation found leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests even without jailbreaking. Simple universal jailbreak templates effectively jailbreak agents, enabling coherent, malicious, multi-step agent behavior.

    - 🔑 Key: [risk/attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: LLM powered GUI agents perform tasks automatically by interpreting and interacting with GUIs. Their autonomy, especially when handling sensitive data, introduces new security risks. Adversaries can exploit the visual processing differences between agents and humans by injecting malicious GUI content, leading to altered agent behaviors or unauthorized private data disclosure. Our study characterized six attacks, testing them on state-of-the-art agents and human users. Findings show agents are highly vulnerable, especially to contextually embedded threats. Human oversight is insufficient, emphasizing the need for privacy-aware agent design and practical defense strategies.

    - 🐙 Github: https://github.com/SALT-NLP/PopupAttack
    - 💻 Env: [Web], [Desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [risk/attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper demonstrates that vision-language model (VLM) agents can be easily deceived by carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, leading them to perform unintended actions such as clicking on these pop-ups instead of completing their assigned tasks. Integrating these pop-ups into environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena resulted in an average attack success rate of 86% and a 47% decrease in task success rate. Basic defense strategies, such as instructing the agent to ignore pop-ups or adding advertisement notices, were found to be ineffective against these attacks.

    - 🐙 Github: https://github.com/ChenWu98/agent-attack
    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [risk/attack], [evaluate]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates the safety risks posed by multimodal agents built on vision-enabled language models (VLMs). The authors introduce two adversarial attack methods: a captioner attack targeting white-box captioners and a CLIP attack that transfers to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate these attacks, they curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena. The study demonstrates that within a limited perturbation norm, the captioner attack can achieve a 75% success rate in making a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute adversarial goals. The paper also discusses the robustness of agents based on other VLMs and provides insights into factors contributing to attack success and potential defenses.
