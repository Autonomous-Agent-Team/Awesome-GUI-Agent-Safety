    - 📖 TLDR: Magentic-UI (Multi-agentic User Interface) is an open-source web interface enabling safe, efficient human–agent collaboration through a flexible multi-agent architecture. It supports web browsing, code execution, and file manipulation, and provides six interaction mechanisms—co-planning, co-tasking, multi-tasking, action guards, answer verification, and long-term memory—to integrate human oversight with AI autonomy. Evaluated via agentic benchmarks, simulated user tests, qualitative user study, and safety assessments, it demonstrates how incorporating human-in-the-loop dynamics can significantly improve agentic systems' reliability and performance.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper identified three key challenges in Federated Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): heterogeneous privacy, structural conversational differences, and dynamic network topologies. To solve these, they introduce Embedded Privacy-Enhancing Agents (EPEAgent). EPEAgent seamlessly integrates into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and context retrieval phases, minimizing data sharing to only task-relevant information. They also created a comprehensive evaluation dataset. Experiments confirm EPEAgent significantly enhances privacy protection while maintaining high system performance.
