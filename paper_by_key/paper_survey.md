    - 📖 TLDR: This paper identifies three key risks, distinguishing them from traditional automation and general autonomous agents. Current evaluations prioritize performance, largely overlooking privacy and security. We review existing metrics and outline five challenges in using human evaluators. To address this, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework. This framework must incorporate risk assessments, enhance user awareness via in-context consent, and embed privacy and security considerations directly into agent design and evaluation.

    - 📖 TLDR: This survey collects and analyzes the different threats faced by these agents. To address the challenges posed by previous taxonomies in handling cross-module and cross-stage threats, we propose a novel taxonomy framework based on the sources and impacts. Additionally, we identify six key features of LLM-based agents, based on which we summarize the current research progress and analyze their limitations. Subsequently, we select four representative agents as case studies to analyze the risks they may face in practical use. Finally, based on the aforementioned analyses, we propose future research directions from the perspectives of data, methodology, and policy, respectively.
