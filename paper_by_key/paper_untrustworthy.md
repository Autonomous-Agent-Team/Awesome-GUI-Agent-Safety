    - 📖 TLDR: Most existing OS agents are designed for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such scenarios, this work proposes a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task completion. This work also introduce VeriOS-Agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying humans in untrustworthy scenarios. [Github](https://github.com/Wuzheng02/VeriOS)
