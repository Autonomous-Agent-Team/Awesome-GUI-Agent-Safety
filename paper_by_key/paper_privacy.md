    - 📖 TLDR: GUI agents automate computer and mobile tasks by directly interacting with on-screen interfaces, but they pose serious privacy risks because screenshots may contain sensitive personal information and are often sent to remote models. These risks depend on interaction context and sequences. This work proposes GUIGuard, a three-stage framework including privacy recognition, protection, and protected task execution. They also introduce GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and fine-grained privacy annotations. Results show current agents have weak privacy recognition, while proper protection can preserve task performance. Privacy recognition remains a key bottleneck for safe GUI agents.

- [AgentDAM: Privacy Leakage Evaluation for Autonomous Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09780)

    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [risk], [privacy]
    - 📖 TLDR: This work presents AGENTDAM, a new benchmark for evaluating whether AI web-navigation agents adhere to the privacy principle of data minimization—using sensitive information only when strictly necessary for a task. It simulates end-to-end web interactions and is adaptable to all existing agents. Evaluations of GPT-4, Llama-3, and Claude agents reveal they often inadvertently process unnecessary private data. The study also proposes a prompting-based defense to reduce leakage and shows that this end-to-end benchmarking offers a more realistic privacy assessment than simply probing LLMs. [Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ai-agent-privacy)

- [Toward a Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for Trustworthy LLM-Powered GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17934)

    - 💻 Env: [Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [risk], [survey], [privacy]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper identifies three key risks, distinguishing them from traditional automation and general autonomous agents. Current evaluations prioritize performance, largely overlooking privacy and security. We review existing metrics and outline five challenges in using human evaluators. To address this, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework. This framework must incorporate risk assessments, enhance user awareness via in-context consent, and embed privacy and security considerations directly into agent design and evaluation.

- [Privacy-Enhancing Paradigms within Federated Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08175)

    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [multi-agent], [evaluation], [dataset], [privacy]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper identified three key challenges in Federated Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): heterogeneous privacy, structural conversational differences, and dynamic network topologies. To solve these, they introduce Embedded Privacy-Enhancing Agents (EPEAgent). EPEAgent seamlessly integrates into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and context retrieval phases, minimizing data sharing to only task-relevant information. They also created a comprehensive evaluation dataset. Experiments confirm EPEAgent significantly enhances privacy protection while maintaining high system performance.

- [EIA: Environmental Injection Attack on Generalist Web Agents for Privacy Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11295)

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [injection], [privacy], [attack]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces the Environmental Injection Attack (EIA), a privacy attack targeting generalist web agents by embedding malicious yet concealed web elements to trick agents into leaking users' PII. Utilizing 177 action steps within realistic web scenarios, EIA demonstrates a high success rate in extracting specific PII and whole user requests. Through its detailed threat model and defense suggestions, the work underscores the challenge of detecting and mitigating privacy risks in autonomous web agents.
