    - 📖 TLDR: Multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) integrate vision, language, and action for unprecedented autonomy in GUI applications, but introduce critical trustworthiness challenges due to their ability to modify digital states. Existing benchmarks are insufficient. This work introduces MLA-Trust, the first unified framework evaluating MLA trustworthiness across four dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety, and privacy, using realistic web and mobile tasks.
