    - 📖 TLDR: Computer use agents, LLM-based systems interacting with GUIs via screenshots or accessibility trees, lack safety evaluation. This paper introduces OS-HARM, a benchmark built on OSWorld with 150 tasks across three harm categories: deliberate misuse, prompt injection, and model misbehavior (e.g., harassment, data exfiltration). An automated judge assesses both accuracy and safety. Frontier models (like o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated show high compliance with misuse queries, vulnerability to static prompt injections, and occasional unsafe actions.

    - 📖 TLDR:  This work proposes SAFEARENA, the first benchmark to focus on the deliberate misuse of web agents. SAFEARENA comprises 250 safe and 250 harmful tasks across four websites. They classify the harmful tasks into five harm categories—misinformation, illegal activity, harassment, cybercrime, and social bias, designed to assess realistic misuses of web agents. To systematically assess the susceptibility to harmful tasks, they introduce the Agent Risk Assessment framework that categorizes agent behavior across four risk levels.
